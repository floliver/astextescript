Script for astexte from epitech

Example of use :java -jar AstexteXLS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -file ‘mytargetfile.xlxs’ -folder "./rendu"
I did it very quickly so any improvements are welcome ! (there is a lot x) )

There is no standalone jar for the moment. So, you have to launch it as specified below.

java -jar target/AstexteXLS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -file "B1-EE-LETTRE-ARGUMENTEE-fichier-notes_ALL-MODELE.xlsx" -folder "./rendu"

Requirement : java 8

Be careful this project use maven in order to get all dependencies. Do not forget to launch it if you want to rebuild.
